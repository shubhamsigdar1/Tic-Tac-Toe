## Tech Used: ![JAVASCRIPT BADGE](https://img.shields.io/badge/JAVASCRIPT-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=FFFFFF)

In this project We were challenged to work in a virtual group to develop a tic-tac-toe game. We use Discord Voice channels for synchronous work flowperiods.
Utilizes HTML to render game interaction and results from JavaScript 2 player game with 8 winning combinations -Players will take turns starting
with Player 1 until a winning combination occurs or all tiles are filled resulting in a draw. -Has reset game; resets upon click (can use in middle
of game or at end) --Renders winner to HTML.

## Optimizations

When I improve this project, I would Like to add Local Storage i.e. If I close my browser and come back I can still start playing games where I last times stops to play.
and then work on UI/UX.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned that creating a successful project, isn't determined by it's complexity.
